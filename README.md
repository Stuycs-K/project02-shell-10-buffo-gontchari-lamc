# Systems Project2 - MyShell

**Chris Ivan Otto**

**Period 10**

**Group Name: WE_HATE_HEADERS**

## Implementations
+ Processes user input
+ cd can support cd ~
+ Redirection
+ Works with files using Windows line-endings
+ Changes home directory to "~"
## Bugs
+ using "exit" and "ctrl+d" if you are in a different directory than the one you ./shell(ed) with, will progressively reprint the file path until you get back to the one you started with, and only then can it exit
## Function Headers
+ We hate them
